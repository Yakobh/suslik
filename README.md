A basic golang gRPC game server implementation

### Description
---
This is going to be a project for a simple game server implementation using gRPC
and golang. This is to generally practice with golang and get some distributed
backend practice for game servers. The intention is for this project to be fairly
scalable and used in different backend game server implementations.
